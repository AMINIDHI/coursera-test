		<p id="p">Paneer (pronounced [pəniːr]) or Indian cottage cheese is a fresh acid-set cheese common in the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh) made from cow or buffalo milk.[1] It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with a fruit- or vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice. Its acid-set form (cheese curd) before pressing is called chhena.</p>
